##Description

Many neighbourhoods, workplaces and schools run recreational baseball leagues. We propose to write a management system that would allow organizers to easily manage their leagues. This system would handle the storage, calculation and processing of season statistics. Using those statistics the system would also handle the scheduling of games. This system would focus purely on statistics and scheduling, it will not handle the rostering of teams and will contain very little personal information about players.
